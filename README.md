# Scuttle Bug Walking Simulation

This project involves MATLAB simulation to analyze the robot's movement as it traversed vertical pipes/terrain. I identified critical forces and pipe width parameters necessary for successful navigation, contributing to the robot's overall design process.

At a given time 3 legs will be in contact with the surface. Based on that below is the free body diagram.

For Scuttle bug moving up in the vertical direction the force distribution on each leg is as follows:

Below is the simulation video:

If one of the leg is not in contact with the verticle surface the robot falls down. Below is the simulation video and force distribution on each leg

If width of the pipe too less for the robot then the robot falls down.

The critical width of the robot and verticle surface 3.4"
